# Executive Summary

**An accuracy level of ... %** has been reached in attributing tweets. 

Tweets come from the account of Candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Two devices have been used to issue tweets: an Android device and an iPhone. The challenge has been to predict the device on the validation set. 

Four types of predictors have been used:

- first, differences in **time patterns**, identified through **Exploratory Data Analysis**;
- second, differences in **token frequencies** (unigrams and bigrams), brought out through **Natural Language Processing** and **Text Mining**;
- third, differences in **sentiments** through **Sentiment Analysis**;
- fourth, differences in sentiment intensity and especially in **hyperbolism**, quantified through **Sentiment Analysis**.

The existence of differences in hyperbolism had been clearly exposed by ... For the record, ... quantified the differences in hyperbolism; our results and conclucions partially diverge from his. During the 2016 US presidential election then candidate Donald J. Trump used his tweeter account as a way to communicate with potential voters. On August 6, 2016 Todd Vaziri tweeted about Trump that "Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him)." Data scientist David Robison conducted an analysis to determine if data supported this assertion. Here we go through David's analysis to learn some of the basics of text mining. 

Tweet attribution has been operated through Machine Learning with one algorithm: eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Several models have been tried and their performances have been evaluated thanks to bootstrapped resampling. The performance metric has been accuracy because the proportion of tweets sent by each device is close to 50 %, which means that a baseline model would have accuracy performance hardly larger than 50 %. 

On the validation set, the accuracy metric has reached ... %, ... percentage points being brought by Sentiment Analysis, ... percentage points by token frequencies and ... percentage points by time predictors.

Beyond prediction performance, previous Sentiment Analysis had mentioned a larger probability ... This project shows that ... Moreover, results are diametrically different when expanding hashtags since most hashtags are in tweets issued by ... 

A clear caveat should be issued: these results are based on Sentiment Analysis based on feelings associated with words. This does not at all take into account context, e.g. sarcasm, which is outside the scope of this project. This does not take on board negation either although negation can reverse sentiment polarity. To investigate that avenue, some Text Analytics has been conducted, showing that negation ...

A second caveat should be clearly expressed about the scope of this project. Data originate from the R package *dslabs*, and in particular from the dataset *trump_tweets*...; the dataset *trump_tweets* has itself been built up out of ...; this means that usage of this project is limited to ... 

Moreover, this project is merely technical; it expresses absolutely no political vision or standpoint; it is in no way person-related; and the author's methods, results and conclusions are only the ones explicitely expressed in this project itself, which only encompasses files lodged with the GitHub repository ...  

A colorblind friendly palette has been used (please see explanations in the next section).

# Welcoming Readers

Dear Readers,

For your convenience, the final document, i.e. ..., is an HTML document with all code available on demand, by pushing tag buttons on the right-hand-side of the HTML document. 

Furthermore, for everyone's convenience, I have tried using color-blind-friendly colors, following pieces of advice given at 
http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/ . The idea is to have distinguishable colors in Protan, Deutan and Tritan vision. I hope this is useful.

# they are used separately.

## Data

Data are downloaded from the dataset *trump_tweets* from the R package *dslabs*. Let's have a look at the features from that dataset. Here are the eight features from the dataset. 

```{r Downloading data, class.output = "bg-info"}

data("trump_tweets")

tweets <- trump_tweets

# Let's normalize the dataset into utf8. Otherwise, 
# a problem was previously encountered with apostrophes: 
# the difference between curly and straight apostrophes 
# can impede stopword removal, especially so in case of 
# contractions; moreover, it can bias token frequency counts 
# by splitting appearances of the same token.

# Thanks to SarahWeaver 
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46814856/use-gsub-to-replace-curly-apostrophe-with-straight-apostrophe-in-r-list-of-chara

tweets$text <- 
  sapply(tweets$text, utf8_normalize, map_quote = TRUE)

rm(trump_tweets)

# Prints data frame description with bg-info layout
# as requested in the chunk header.
str(tweets, vec.len = 1)

```

<br>

Documentation is available at ?trump_tweets in an R session.

Let's extract the relevant data, i.e. tweets issued by the Android device and by the iPhone. 

<br>

## Squeezing Data

We are interested in what happened during the campaign, so for the analysis here we will focus on what was tweeted between the day Trump announced his campaign and election day. So we define the following table. Here are the eight features again, this time from the new dataset, i.e. the squeezed dataset.

```{r Squeezing dataset, class.output = "bg-info"}

# The device names are kept only for both devices
# we are interested in. Moreover, they are simplified.

# The tweets are kept only if they were tweeted
# between the day Trump announced his campaign 
# and election day.

temporary_data_set <- tweets %>% 
  mutate(device = str_replace_all(
    str_replace_all(source, "Twitter for Android", "Android"), 
    "Twitter for iPhone", "iPhone")) %>%  
  filter(device %in% c("Android", "iPhone") &
         created_at >= ymd("2015-06-17") & 
         created_at < ymd("2016-11-08")) %>%  
  select(- source)

rm(tweets)

# Prints data frame description with bg-info layout
# as requested in chunk header.
str(temporary_data_set, vec.len = 1)

```

<br>

The table above tells us, among others, that the total number of rows is 3,950.

This is only one fifth of the original dataset but the number of observations suffices in principle to apply machine learning algorithms, even if the dataset is split into training set and validation set. 

Let's have a look at each variable. 

**id_str** is the tweet identifier. 

Is it an operational identifier: is it exclusively comprised of unique values?

```{r Checking up uniqueness of identifiers}

# Calculates number of observations and 
# number of unique identifiers. 

row_number <- nrow(temporary_data_set)
unique_identifiers <- length(unique(temporary_data_set$id_str))

# Table with both variables

tab <- data.frame(format(row_number, big.mark = " "),
                  format(unique_identifiers, big.mark = " ")) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Number of Observations", 
                 "Number of Unique Identifiers"))

# Prints table with "bg-info" layout. 

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c", 
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-info\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

rm(tab)
```

The number of unique identifiers is exactly the number of tweets. Which means that the identifier has a different value for each tweet, which is a requirement for an identifier. Consequently, we'll keep this identifier.

**source** The source variable tells us the device that was used to compose and upload each tweet. We already know it is a character vector. Actually, it is the dependent variable or label: tweet attribution will be attribution of tweets either to the first device or to the second one. It might be interesting to know the breakdown of tweets by device.

```{r Breakdown of tweets by device}

# Table with breakdown of tweets by device

tab <- data.frame(temporary_data_set$device) %>%
  group_by(temporary_data_set$device) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            perc = n * 100 / length(temporary_data_set$device)) %>%
  mutate(n = format(n, big.mark = " ")) %>%
  mutate(perc = paste(round(perc, 0), "%", sep = " ")) 

# The next part from this code chunk constructs and prints 
# a table with a freely customizable header. 

# First, column names from tab are removed.

names(tab) <- NULL

# A new vector of column names is created. 

name <- c("Device", 
          "Number of Tweets by Device",
          "Percentage of Tweets by Device")

# Assembles tab and the vector of column names
# which becomes the first row and appears 
# as the new header which is largely customizable.

tab <- rbind(name, tab) 

# Prints the table.

knitr::kable(tab, "html", align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, 
           color = white, background = deep_blue) %>%
  row_spec(2, color = white, background = bluish_green) %>%
  row_spec(3, color = white, background = gray) 

rm(tab)

```

<br>

As shown in the table above, tweets by the iPhone are somewhat more numerous but the difference in percentage is limited.

A baseline model would predict device attributing to all observations the class with the most occurrences, i.e. iPhone. This would deliver very low prediction accuracy. 

Consequently, accuracy appears to be a rather satisfactory performance metric. It will be the performance metric in this project. 

**text**: the tweet itself; the tweets are represented by the text variable. Actually, the tweets will produce a lot of predictors — or independent variables — such as tokens, mentions, sentiment measurements or hyperbolism measurements. Thsi will be substantially developed in the following sections.

**created_at** containing the date and time at which the tweet was tweeted." 

It can be essential. It can deliver several predictors such as month, day, hour, etc. Again, this will be strongly developed in further sections. 

There are also two predictor candidates that relate to the tweeter's behaviour: *in_reply_to_user_id_str* and *is_retweet*. They might be good predictors. This will be investigated in the exploratory data analysis. 

*is_retweet*: "A logical telling us if it is a retweet or not." We see in the table above that the first value is *FALSE*; are there any "TRUE" values? It is a matter of variability: are there enough variations in this variable? 

```{r Checking for TRUE in is_retweet}

# Number of FALSE/TRUE values in is_retweet 
# in order to check up whether there are TRUE values. 

number_true <- sum(temporary_data_set$is_retweet)
number_false <- 
  length(temporary_data_set$is_retweet) - number_true

# Tab with number of FALSE/TRUE values in is_retweet

tab <- 
  data.frame(event = c("FALSE", "TRUE"), 
             number = c(number_false, number_true)) %>%
  mutate(number = format(number, big.mark = " ")) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Is the Tweet Actually a Retweet?",
                      "Number of Tweets"))

# Prints table with bg-info layout.

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c", 
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-info\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

rm(tab)
```

We can see that there is no TRUE value. This won't be investigated any further. This variable will be excluded since all values are *FALSE* and there is no variation.   

There can be some copy-paste inside of tweets, though. Could that be identified on the basis of quotes? This is a matter of analysis of the variable *text*, of the tweets themselves; it is a matter of content analysis; it will be done in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the training set on not on the part of the dataset that will become the validation set. 

*retweet_count*: "How many times tweet had been retweeted at time dataset was created." 

Would it make sense? Attribution would be made partially on the basis of other people's reactions! It is also dependent on the inventory date! It can prove an impactful predictor.

*favorite_count* is a problem similar to that of retweet_count.

As far as the last two variables are concerned, there could be prediction with them as predictors and one without them. This will be further investigated in the exploratory data analysis.

<br>

## Training Set

What about the training set?

In the previous section, we have noticed that the number of observations is almost 4,000 and the breakdown by device is almost even.

Let's take a prudent approach when splitting data in order to preemptively avoid suboptimal representation.

The number of rows suffices to reach statistical representativeness even in case of splitting into training set and validation set. It would be unadvisable to split more finely between training set, test set and validation set, though: this would further reduce the size of samples and, anyway, training set model optimization can be readily operated through e.g. bootstrapped resampling. 

The splitting proportion will be two thirds for the training set and one third for the validation set. What's the number of tweets by device in the training set?

```{r Splitting into training and validation sets and counting tweets by device}

# Creating the index of the validation set at random.

set.seed(1)
ind_val <- 
  createDataPartition(y = temporary_data_set$device, times = 1, 
                      p = 1/3, list = FALSE)

# Deducting the index of the training set.
ind_train <- as.integer(setdiff(1:nrow(temporary_data_set), ind_val))

# Creating the training set.
train_tweets <- temporary_data_set[ind_train, ]

# Creating the validation set. 
val_tweets <- temporary_data_set[ind_val, ]

rm(temporary_data_set, ind_val, ind_train)

# Table with tweet count by device

tab <- train_tweets %>% 
  group_by(device) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(n = format(n, big.mark = " ")) 

# The next part from this code chunk constructs and prints 
# a table with a freely customizable header. 

# First, column names from tab are removed.

names(tab) <- NULL

# A new vector of column names is created. 

name <- 
  c("Device",
    "Number of Tweets by Device in the Training Set")

# Assembles tab and the vector of column names
# which becomes the first row and appears 
# as the new header which is largely customizable.

tab <- rbind(name, tab) 

# Prints the table.

knitr::kable(tab, "html", align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, 
           color = white, background = deep_blue) %>%
  row_spec(2, color = white, background = bluish_green) %>%
  row_spec(3, color = white, background = gray) 

rm(tab)
```

# Way Forward

Now, let's get insights from the four groups of predictors:

- publication time: *created_at*,
- interaction: *in_reply_to_user_id_str*, *retweet_count* and *favorite_count*,
- token frequencies in *text*,
- sentiment nature and intensity in *text*.

About date and time, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),  exploring whether various predictors would seem relevant; morevoer, it will be an opportunity to check up whether each device's timing is so different from the other one that shift work is highly probable.

About interaction, we'll check up whether each candidate for predictor shows significant variation from one device to the other. 

Through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining, token frequencies will be scrutinized. Do we habe significant differences between devices? Are differences stable or do they modify over time? Tokens can also be proper nouns, data (a device could possibly use more data), symbols (e.g. #1 can more frequent with one device, mentions and links. Mentions will also be split. MAGA will be explicited and split; we will check whether this impacts predictive power or not.

Sentiment analysis will be conducted. Words will be linked to sentiments, on the basis of preexisting sentiment files. They will also be ranked as positively polarized words or negatively polarized words and in intensity, once again on the basis of a preexisting file. Word intensity will be a criterion to measure up hyperbolism. Predictive power will be checked, as well for sentiments as for positiveness and negativeness and as for hyperbolism.

<br>

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's try to obtain some pre-emptive insights into tweets in order to better construct candidate predictors for tweet attribution. 

<br>

## Introduction 

The tidytext package helps us convert from text into a tidy table. Having the data in this format greatly facilitates data visualization and applying statistical techniques.

The main function needed to achieve this is unnest_tokens. A token refers to the units that we are considering to be a data point. The most common tokens will be words, but they can also be single characters, ngrams, sentences, lines or patterns defined by a regex. The functions will take a vector of strings and extract the tokens so that each one gets a row in the new table. 

Note that the function tries to convert tokens into words and strips characters important to twitter such as # and @. A token in twitter is not the same as in regular english. For this reason instead of using the default, words, we define a regex that captures twitter character. The pattern appears complex but all we are defining is a patter that starts with @, # or neither and is followed by any combination of letter or digits.

The first thing will be the number of hashtags, of mentions and of links to pictures. 

OBJECTIVES

We've got several and very different intermediary objectives, but the final objective is the same, i.e. attributing tweets to devices.

Intermediary objectives:
- words with high frequencies for one device and only a few ones (or at least fewer ones) for the other device;
- sentiments with high occurrence for one device and low occurrence (or at least lower) for the other one. 

In a first step, for both intermediary objectives, we do not necessarily need to discard stopwords. Why?

As far as sentiments are concerned, actually, there will be matching between the file (or files) of words from the tweets and the lexicons encompassing words supposedly liked to sentiments. If stopwords do not match any lexicon word, they will be discarded anyway. Moreover, discarding stopwords before matching could be couterproductive: some stopwords from some lists appear in some lexicons, e.g. "great"! Two examples! 

As far as word frequencies are concerned, the same reasoning holds, mutatis mutandis: if for some stopwords frequencies differ between devices, that can be effectual while attributing tweets. 

For sentiment, comparison strategy is simple: simple matching between lists of words and lexicon lists; selecting sentiments with diverging frequencies and high frequencies for one device. 

For words, comparison strategy is a bit more complex: comparing frequencies between devices; selecting words with diverging frequencies and high frequencies for one device. 

Actually, the criterion is not so much about percentage comparison, it is much more about absolute occurrence. If word frequencies are 10 for one device and 1 for the other one, OK word frequency is ten times higher for the first device, but it is not relevant on 2,633 tweets. But if word frequencies are 500 and 100, that can be significant even if ratio is "only" 5:1 instead of 10:1 in the first example. 

One expansion has to be provided: not only words matter to attribute tweets, but also the frequency of 
- hashtags, 
- mentions,
- links to videos,
- the $ symbol
- and #1 . 

Before getting started with Natural Language Processing and Text Mining, let's build up some standard data sets: vectors of URLs, mentions, and hashtags; tweets without URLs and/or mentions and/or hashtags.

```{r Standard data sets}

# In case 2 URLs might stick to each other, let's use buffer
# with empty space character before URLs when extracting URLs.
buffer <- str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, "http", " http")

# Extracts URLs.
urls <- str_extract_all(buffer, "https://\\S+|http://\\S+")
rm(buffer)

# Converts a list of lists into a character vector.
urls <- unlist(urls)

# Drop punctuation at the end of extractions.
urls <- str_replace_all(urls, "[:punct:]+$", "")

# Keeps only unique URLs.
urls <- unique(urls)

# Escape characters in front of question marks in URLs.
urls_with_question_marks <- 
  str_replace_all(urls, "\\?", "\\\\?")

# URLs assembled into a REGEX pattern for Text Mining
urls_as_pattern <- 
  paste(urls_with_question_marks, "|", sep = "", collapse = "")
urls_as_pattern <- 
  str_replace(urls_as_pattern, "\\|$", "")

# Data frame with URLs being replaced with a placeholder in all tweets. 

buffer <- train_tweets$text 

for (i in 1:length(urls)) {

  buffer <- 
    str_replace_all(buffer, 
                    urls_with_question_marks[i], 
                    "URLPLACEHOLDER")
  
}

tweets_without_urls <- train_tweets %>%
  select(id_str, device) %>%
  mutate(text = buffer) %>%
  select(id_str, text, device)

# Let's now compute the number of URL instances per tweet.  

urls_count <- str_count(train_tweets$text, urls_as_pattern)

# or

urls_count <- 
  str_count(tweets_without_urls$text, "URLPLACEHOLDER")

# Number of unique URLs
n_u <- length(urls)

# Mentions

mentions <- str_extract_all(tweets_without_urls$text,
                            "\\.@\\w+|@\\w+")

mentions <- unique(unlist(mentions))

mentions_as_pattern <- paste(mentions, "|", sep = "", collapse = "")

mentions_as_pattern <- str_replace(mentions_as_pattern, "\\|$", "")

# Hashtags

hashtags <- str_extract_all(tweets_without_urls$text, "#\\w+")

hashtags <- unique(unlist(hashtags))

hashtags_as_pattern <- paste(hashtags, "|", sep = "", collapse = "")

hashtags_as_pattern <- str_replace(hashtags_as_pattern, "\\|$", "")

# Tweets without URLS and mentions

text <- str_replace_all(tweets_without_urls$text, 
                        mentions_as_pattern,
                        "MENTIONPLACEHOLDER")

tweets_without_urls_mentions <- 
  tweets_without_urls %>%
  mutate(text = text)

# Tweets without URLS and hashtags

text <- str_replace_all(tweets_without_urls$text, 
                        hashtags_as_pattern,
                        "HASHTAGPLACEHOLDER")

```

Let's have a first look at Android tweets, as a first step in exploratory data analysis. 

```{r Having a first look at Android tweets}

tab <- train_tweets %>% 
  select(created_at, text, device) %>%
  filter(device == "Android") %>%
  select(- device) %>%
  mutate(created_at = format(created_at, usetz = TRUE)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("DATETIME", 
                 "TWEETS SENT BY THE ANDROID DEVICE"))

# Creating an interactive data table, using the DT package. 

# Will color and background color header.

initComplete <- 
  c("function(settings, json) {
        ", 
        "$(this.api().table().header()).css({
            'background-color': '#009E73', 'color': 'White'
            });", 
        "}
    ")

# Will color and background color body text.

rowCallback <-
  c("function(row, data, index, rowId) {
        ",
        "console.log(rowId)", 
        "if(rowId >= 0) {
            ",
            "row.style.backgroundColor = '#009E73',
            row.style.color = 'white';",
            "}",
        "}
    ")

# Prints datatable. 

datatable(tab, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", 
  options = 
    list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = T,
         columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', 
                                targets = 0:(ncol(tab) - 1))),
         initComplete = JS(initComplete),
         rowCallback = JS(rowCallback)))

rm(tab)

```

And now, let's have a look at the same table but for the iPhone.

```{r Having a first look at iPhone tweets}

  select(created_at, text, device) %>%
  filter(device == "iPhone") %>%

                                targets = 0:(ncol(tab) - 1))),
         initComplete = JS(initComplete),
         rowCallback = JS(rowCallback)))

rm(tab)

```

Hasty conclusion with some preemptive insights.

First about Android tweets:

- many capitalized words,
- MAGA expanded, capitalized and not in hashtag,
- more mentions,
- quotes are double ones,
- not many urls.

Second about iPhone tweets:

- lots of urls, much more than in Android tweets,
- also more hashtags, but difference might be less important,
- MAGA expanded but in hashtags,
- simple quotes,
- numerous &amp,
- rather numerous hyphens followed by empry space,
- numerous tweets do not end with a period. 

These are some differences without paying much attention to words but mainly to typography. We can go some further and pay more attention to differences in using punctuation marks ... before getting rid of punctuation marks to disentangle words. 

Let's check up how much tweets from the two devices differ in occurrence of these typographical patterns. 

Let's deal with URLs first.

<br>

## Punctuation Marks

Punctuation marks can be one characteristic of a style, of a twitter. Consequently, it might be productive to pinpoint punctuation marks that are used differently by the two devices, be it in frequency, or in combination with other text components. That's a stylometry approach. Let's, on the contrary, observe punctuation patterns and try to differentiate in that field between the two devices. 

We are going to work without URLs, which have been dealt with separately and they have shown huge imbalance in favor of th iPhone. URLs can contain numerous periods (full stops), or colons, or other punctuation marks; URLs would impact prediction as URLs but also as punctuation receptacles and this might obliterate the specific impact of some punctuation marks meant as punctuation marks in plain text and possibly, in some cases, imbalances in favor of the Android device, which could possibly reveal as useful co-predictors.  

Let's start with single punctuation mark frequency. 

```{r 1st graph about frequency of single punctuation marks}

# iPhone data when comparing the two devices. We'll keep 
# the comparability factor for further use.

Dot comma colon double quotation mark

The two devices diverge by some punctuation marks being present very differently from a quantitative point of view. This is the case for the following punctuation marks: dots, question marks, commas, colons, slashes, dollar signs, en dashes, em dashes, opening parenthesis, closing parentheses, double quotes. Imbalances can also be quantitatively important for other punctuation marks, but nevertheless less as a procentual ratio. 

There are no percentage marks because combinations of numbers directly followed with the percentage mark have been discarded; they will be treated separately, among special sequences. The same holds, *mutatis mutandis*, for the & mark because the special sequence *&amp;* has also been discarded and will also be tackled among special sequences; the same again for the semi-colon. Semi-colon appears once, & and % do not appear at all. 

To be extremely accurate, let's notice that the numbers of instances could be a little revised for the underscore: the code above has discarded neither mentions nor hashtags; since the mentions and hashtags are comprised of a few underscore marks, this impacts the numbers of instances in the table above; but there is no substantial imbalance for the underscore mark between the two devices in the table above, consequently, the matter will not be investigated any further. 

By the way, hyphens are numerous. There are only a few en dashes and em dashes, but all of them on the iPhone side. 

Something quantitavely more important. The imbalance in double quotes was expected since we had already pinpointed that the Android device uses double quotes and that the iPhone uses single quotes: consequently, it is absolutely normal to have much more double quotes in tweets sent by the Android device than in tweets sent by the iPhone. But couldn't we expect the inverse imbalance for single quotes? Actually, no, we couldn't. Why? Because there are many short forms (contractions such as it's) on both sides. There are also genitive possessive forms ('s or s'). Consequently, there are many *single quotes* as well on the side of the Android device, well actually apostrophes. We have to eliminate these apostrophes with a view to keeping (almost) only single quotes, hopefully with a strong imbalance in favor of the iPhone. 

Consequently, we will discard apostrophes from short forms and from possessive forms. A list of short forms can be extracted from a list a stopwords, e.g. a list of stopwords from the package stopwords. To the extracted short forms we will add the short form *havn't*, which is obsolete according to https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/havn%27t . The apostrophe of this short form has to be discarded just as the apostrophes from the *standard* short forms. But since it is used only by the Android device, it will be added to other *special sequences* below.

Now focus will be moved to multiple punctuation marks, i.e. several times the same punctuation mark in a row, e.g. two hyphens in a row, two dots in a row, etc.

From a global point of view, interesting from dollar. Only the iPhone is present in en dashes, em dashes and plus signs: very limited frequencies but could be a characteristic of one entity.

Let's check up how the rule *no odd number of single quotations* works. First, in tweets from the Android device. 

```{r Showing all Android tweets keeping apostrophes or single quotation marks}

index <- 
  str_detect(tweets_without_urls_and_apostrophes$text, "\\'")
index <- which(index == T)

  select(- device) %>%
  `colnames<-`(NULL)

# Vector of column names

name <- c("Identifier",
          "Android Tweet with Remaining ' Mark",
          "Counted as Quotation Mark")

# Constructs a table, taking the vector of column names
# as a row for formatting convenience.

tab <- rbind(name, tab) 

# Prints the table.

knitr::kable(tab, "html", align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, 
           color = white, background = bluish_green) %>%
  row_spec(2, color = white, background = bluish_green)

```

There are no single quotation marks. There remain one apostrophe among Android tweets in *Cruz' constitutional law professor*. *Cruz'* has been preferred to *Cruz's*. See e.g. https://www.grammar-monster.com/punctuation/apostrophe_after_z.html . In *Cruz's*, the apostrophe would have been discarded. It is not discarded in *Cruz'* but this peculiarity is compensated by the rule *no odd number of single quotations*: since the number of ' marks is one and thus an odd number, it is decreased with one and so becomes zero. 

Let's now have a look at single quotation marks and remaining apostrophes among iPhone tweets. 

```{r Showing all iPhone tweets with single quotation marks}

index <- 
  str_detect(tweets_without_urls_and_apostrophes$text, "\\'")

            });", 
        "}
    ")

# Will color and background color body text.

  c("function(row, data, index, rowId) {

            "row.style.backgroundColor = 'Gray',
            row.style.color = 'White';",
            "}",
        "}
    ")

# Prints datatable. 

datatable(tab, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", 
  options = 
    list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = T,
         columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', 
                                targets = 0:(ncol(tab) - 1))),
         initComplete = JS(initComplete),
         rowCallback = JS(rowCallback)))

``` 

All instances of the punctuation mark *'* are registered as quotation marks except for one instance in tweet with identifier 736410143378792448: it is an apostrophe in the possessive form included in *refugees social media accounts*. This will not impact the count of quotation marks: indeed, since the number of instances of the punctuation mark *'* is 1, i.e. an odd number, it is decreased with 1 and becomes ... zero, in accordance with our rule *no odd number of single quotations*.

### Enclosed Punctuation

Let's go ahead with enclosed punctuation marks. What is an enclosed punctuation mark in this project? It is simply a punctuation mark that has neither leading nor trailing empty space. 

We'll work outside of URLs. We are going to work without URLs, which are comprised of numerous enclosed punctuation marks. Discarding URLs without replacing them with placeholders slightly diminishes the number of enclosed punctuation marks because of a few punctuation marks being enclosed between URLs and other parts from the tweets. These cases can be considered as proportionally rare. 

```{r Number of tweets with enclosed punctuation marks outside of URLs}

# Generates a random placeholder for enclosed punctuation.
set.seed(1)
enclosed_punctuation_placeholder <-
  paste(sample(c(0:9, letters, LETTERS), 16), collapse = "")

# Replaces enclosed punctuation with placeholder: round 1!
text <- tweets_without_urls$text
text <- 
  str_replace_all(text, 
    "((?![:punct:])[^\\s])([:punct:]+)((?![:punct:])[^\\s])",
    paste("\\1", enclosed_punctuation_placeholder, "\\3"))
                  
# In case instances of enclosed punctuation stick to each other
# some instances can escape replacement. In e.g. S.C./N.H./N.Y.
# only three sequences are replaced: S.C    N.H    N.Y
# Two sequences could not be replaced: C./N    H./N
# In order to have 5 instances of the placeholder,
# let's launch a second replacement round.

text <- 
  str_replace_all(text, 
    "((?![:punct:])[^\\s])([:punct:]+)((?![:punct:])[^\\s])",
    paste("\\1", enclosed_punctuation_placeholder, "\\3"))

The biggest imbalance in absolute numbers is for zero enclosed punctuation sequence per tweet. But imbalance are bigger in percentage for 2 or 3 enclosed punctuation sequences per tweet, the Android device being above 70 %. The number of enclosed punctuation sequences per tweet seems a valuable candidate predictor.

But that is a global statistic. Statistics can be produced by type of enclosed punctuation sequence. E.g. in *S.H./N.C./N.Y.* we have five enclosed punctuation sequences: .    ./     .    ./    . 

Below, we will distinguish the different punctuation marks.

We are looking for even more heavily unbalanced numbers. For two, three or four enclosed punctuation sequences per tweet, there is some imbalance between the number of tweets involved by device. 

Maybe we can find that in subgroups of the tweets with enclosed punctuation. In order to potentially delineate such subgroups, let's have a look at these tweets. 

```{r Android tweets with enclosed punctuation marks}

# Table with single enclosed punctuation marks 
# in Android tweets

tab <- tweets_without_urls %>%
  select(device, text) %>%
  mutate(index = tweets_with_enclosed_punctuation$index) %>%
  filter(device == "Android" & index > 0) %>%
  select(text, index) %>%

            });",

Enclosed punctuation sequences are often about numbers with thousand or decimal separators, about time and date. These will be dealt with under special sequences later on. 

The same presentation will be done now for the iPhone.

Dot is enclosed dot. Can be enclosed in any non empty character except for dots. Further refinement with numbers, time and date.

Nine possibly interesting sequences 

- \n 
- &amp 
- closing parenthesis with no empty space character around,
- tweet ending with exclamation mark,
- tweet ending with question mark,
- tweet ending with period (full stop),
- tweet ending wiht alphanumeric,
- digit or sequence of digits,
- numbers with thousands separator,
- numbers with decimal part, 
- A.M. or P.M.
- 00:00am or 00:00pm
- 00/00/00 or 00/00/0000
- U.S.
- U.S.A.
- Lyin' or lyin' or LYIN'
- #1 with no alphanumeric following

Percentual numbers show a rather limited imbalance. 

*lyin'* is rather typical of the Android device. The same holds for *ya'* and *havn't*, but occurrence frequency is very limited.

Let's notice that *USA* without dots doesn't show the same imbalance between devices. And *US* can be found in a lot ow words.

We can investigate the frequency of a difference that has also been noticed: the abbreviations of American States are generally with dots in Android tweets and without dots in iPhone tweets. 

Outside of mentions and hashtags. 

```{r Abbreviations of American States without dots}

# List of abbreviations of American States without dots

state_abb_without_dots <- state.abb

# Replacing State abbreviations with placeholder.

buffer <- 
  tweets_without_urls_mentions_hashtags$text

for (i in 1:length(state_abb_without_dots)) {
  
  buffer <- 
    str_replace_all(buffer, 
      paste("(^", state_abb_without_dots[i], 
            ")([\\s[:punct:]])", sep = ""),
      "ABBPLACEHOLDER\\2")
  
  buffer <- 
    str_replace_all(buffer, 
      paste("([\\s[:punct:]])(", state_abb_without_dots[i],

      paste("([\\s[:punct:]])(", state_abb_without_dots[i], 
            ")([\\s[:punct:]])", sep = ""),
      "\\1ABBPLACEHOLDER\\3")
  
}

  train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(text = buffer) %>%
  mutate(n = str_count(text, "ABBPLACEHOLDER")) %>%

# The next part from this code chunk constructs and prints

# A new vector of column names is created.

          "Number of Instances of State Abbreviations without Dots")

# Assembles tab and the vector of column names
# which becomes the first row and appears

tab <- rbind(name, tab) 

# Prints the table.

knitr::kable(tab, "html", align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, 
           color = white, background = deep_blue) %>%
  row_spec(2, color = white, background = bluish_green) %>%
  row_spec(3, color = white, background = gray) 

```

Actually, the difference between devices is big for abbreviations without dots.  

Let's count abbreviations with dots. Actually, the number of State abbreviations with dots was checked and is very limited. But the very concept has been extended to other abbreviations as well with two letters and dots. a

These will be 2-letter abbreviations in uppercase with dots after each letter. They will be surrounded by empty space characters or punctuation marks other than dots. They can also stand at the front of the tweet with no character before the abbreviation and an empty space character after it or a punctuation mark other than a dot. Or, last scenario, they can be at the end of a tweet, with no character after it, and before either an empty space character or a punctuation mark other than a dot. 

```{r 2 letter abbreviations with dots}

# First, abbreviations with empty space character 
# or punctuation mark other than dot in front of them 
# and behind them

buffer <- tweets_without_urls_mentions_hashtags$text

  mutate(text = buffer) %>%

# Prints the table.

knitr::kable(tab, "html", align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, 
           color = white, background = deep_blue) %>%

  row_spec(3, color = white, background = gray) 


rm(buffer, tab1, tab2, tab3, tab_global)

```

This is a promising candidate predictor, with the Android device producing more than 90% of such abbreviations, in spite of the iPhone having slightly more tweets.

Let's not forget that there are 50 instances of *U.S.* on the Android side and 11 on the iPhone side. This means that for other 2-letter abbreviations with dots there are almost no instances from the iPhone, actually only 4, against 112 for the Android device. It might be worthwhile having two candidate predictors instead of just one, a predictor about *U.S.* and a predictor with the other 2-letter abbreviations with dots.

  row_spec(2, color = white, background = bluish_green) %>%
  row_spec(3, color = white, background = gray) 

```

Short forms are globally more numerous in Android tweets than in iPhone tweets. The more so if we take into consideration the number of iPhone short forms regularized for sample size, i.e. decreased inn proportion with the greater number of iPhone tweets. 

This might be a productive predictor, coming from function words, i.e. no content words. 

Let's compute the number of each short form for each device. 

```{r Which short forms}

# A list of short forms has been established in the 
# code chunk above and has been kept.

list_short_forms <- sort(list_short_forms)

# For loop to compute for each short form the number 
# of instances in Android tweets or in iPhone tweets

# Tweets will be lowercased since the short forms are
# already lowercased. 

l <- length(list_short_forms)

buffer <- tweets_without_urls_mentions_hashtags$text
buffer <- str_to_lower(buffer, locale = "en")

output <- data.frame(matrix(l * 4, nrow = l, ncol = 4) * 1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Short Form Lowercased",
                 "Number of Instances in Android Tweets",
                 "Number of Instances in iPhone Tweets",
                 "iPhone Number Regularized for Sample Size"))

for (i in 1:length(list_short_forms)) {
 
  temp <- train_tweets %>%
    select(device) %>%
    mutate(text = buffer) %>%
    mutate(n = str_count(text, list_short_forms[i])) %>%
    select(- text) %>%
    group_by(device) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(n)) 
  
  output[[i, 1]] <- list_short_forms[i]
  output[[i, 2]] <- temp$n[1]
  output[[i, 3]] <- temp$n[2]
  output[[i, 4]] <- round(temp$n[2] * comparability_factor[2], 0)
  
}

# Creating the interactive data table, using the DT package. 

datatable(output, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", 
          
          options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = T,
                         
          # Sets background color and font color in header.              
                         
            initComplete = JS(
              "function(settings, json) {",
              "$(this.api().table().header()).css({
                  'background-color': '#0072B2', 
                  'color': 'white'});", 
              "}"),
            
          # Sets background color in rows.  
            
            rowCallback = JS(
              'function(row, data, index, rowId) {',
              'console.log(rowId)',
              'if(rowId >= 0) {',
                   'row.style.backgroundColor = "#9ad2f2";','}',
              '}')
            )
          )

rm(buffer, output)

```

Some short forms show serious imbalance between devices. In favor of the Android device, let's pinpoint *don't*, *doesn't*, or *can't*. In favor of the iPhoe, e.g. *i'm*. For some short forms, the number of instances can be considered as acceptacle candidate predictors. 

But if Android short forms are more numerous, it seems to come from negational short forms, mainly or totally. We are not dealing here, in stylometry, with content, but there seems to be at least that sub-group among short forms. Let's compute numbers of instances.

```{r Negational or affirmative short forms}

# We already have a list of short forms, which has been kept.
# Let's split it into negational and affirmative short forms. 

# First a list of negational short forms

index <- str_detect(list_short_forms, "n't$")
index <- which(index == TRUE)

list_negational_short_forms <- list_short_forms[index]

list_negational_short_forms_as_pattern <- 
  paste(list_negational_short_forms, "|", sep = "", collapse = "")

list_negational_short_forms_as_pattern <- 
  str_replace(list_negational_short_forms_as_pattern, "\\|$", "")

# Second a list of affirmative short forms

index <- str_detect(list_short_forms, "n't$")
index <- which(index == FALSE)

list_affirmative_short_forms <- list_short_forms[index]

list_affirmative_short_forms_as_pattern <- 
  paste(list_affirmative_short_forms, "|", sep = "", collapse = "")

list_affirmative_short_forms_as_pattern <- 
  str_replace(list_affirmative_short_forms_as_pattern, "\\|$", "")

# In order to facilitate text mining about quotation marks,
# let's lower case the tweets since the short forms are
# already lowercased. 

buffer <- tweets_without_urls_mentions_hashtags$text
buffer <- str_to_lower(buffer, locale = "en")

# Computing numbers of negational short forms

tab1 <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(text = buffer) %>%
  mutate(n = str_count(text, 
               list_negational_short_forms_as_pattern)) %>%
  group_by(device) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
  select(device, n) 
  
tab1 <- spread(tab1, device, n) %>%
  mutate(name = "Negational Short Forms") %>%
  select(name, everything()) 

tab2 <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(text = buffer) %>%
  mutate(n = str_count(text, 
               list_affirmative_short_forms_as_pattern)) %>%
  group_by(device) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
  select(device, n) 
  
tab2 <- spread(tab2, device, n) %>%
  mutate(name = "Affirmative Short Forms") %>%
  select(name, everything()) 

tab_global <- rbind(tab1, tab2[1, ]) %>%
  mutate(n_reg = round(.[3] * comparability_factor[2], 0)) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Type of Short Forms",
                 "Number of Instances from Android",
                 "Number of Instances from iPhone",
                 "iPhone Number Regularized for Sample Size"))

knitr::kable(tab_global, align = "c",  
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-primary\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

Interestingly enough, the table above shows that global imbalance in favor of the Android device is entirely due to negational short forms, and even a little bit more: indeed, there are more affirmative short forms in tweets from the iPhone. 

As a global predictor, the number of negational short forms should be preferred to the number of all short forms. But, maybe short forms should be used separately because of diversity in numbers. Some short forms with imbalance. 

Anyway, this emphasizes a useful notion: negation, which seems more frequent in tweets from the Android device. Irrespective of content words, let's investigate some further, with words such as *no*, *not*, or *never*.

### Negational Stopwords

```{r Negationnal stopwords other than negational short forms}

# List of negational stopwords other than negational short forms 
# with no leading nor trailing alphanumeric characters

# Negational stopwords are lowercased and so will be all tweets.
 
negational_stopwords <- c("no", "not", "never", "cannot")

output <- data.frame(matrix(length(negational_stopwords) * 4, 
                            nrow = length(negational_stopwords), 
                            ncol = 4) * 1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Negational Stopwords", 
                 "Number of Instances from Android",
                 "Number of Instances from iPhone",
                 "Number of Instances from iPhone Regularized 
                 for Sample Size"))

for (i in 1:length(negational_stopwords)) {
  
  # URLS are excluded because they can contain punctuation marks,
  # as well as mentions and hashtags because they can contain
  # underscores. 
  buffer <- tweets_without_urls_mentions_hashtags$text
  
  # Negational stopwords must be surrounded by empty space
  # characters or non empty characters except for alphanumeric.
  pattern <- 
    paste("(\\s|((?![:alnum:])\\S))", negational_stopwords[i], 
          "(\\s|((?![:alnum:])\\S))", sep = "")
  
  # Looking for pattern by device. 
  occurrence_negational_stopword <- 
    train_tweets %>% 
    select(device) %>%
    mutate(text = buffer) %>%
    mutate(number = str_count(text, pattern)) %>%
    group_by(device) %>%
    summarise(number = sum(number)) %>%
    mutate(n_reg = round(number * comparability_factor, 0)) 

  # Inserting results from iteration i into output data frame.
  output[[i, 1]] <- negational_stopwords[i]
  output[[i, 2]] <- occurrence_negational_stopword$number[1]
  output[[i, 3]] <- occurrence_negational_stopword$number[2] 
  output[[i, 4]] <- occurrence_negational_stopword$n_reg[2]

}

# Prints table.

knitr::kable(output, align = "c",  
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-primary\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

The first three negational stopwords can be considered interesting candidate predictors. The fourth one shows imbalance but low frequency. 

We are going to terminate here with our looking for punctuation marks, special characters and special sequences as candidate predictors, not because our search has been exhaustive, which it is not, but we already have harvested some strong candidate predictors in the spirit of stylometry. These strong candidate predictors will constitute a data set, more specifically a data frame. 

### URLs

```{r Getting operational presentations of URLs}

# Table: statistics about URLs 

tab <- data.frame(a = 1, b = 2) %>%
  mutate(a = sum(urls_count), b = n_u) %>%
  mutate(a = format(a, big.mark = " "), 
         b = format(b, big.mark = " ")) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Number of URL Insertions",
                 "Number of Unique URLs"))

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c",  
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-primary\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

Now, let's move to URLs by device. 

```{r URLs 2 URLS by device, class.output = "bg-primary"}

# Vector of URLs from ANDROID per training set observation  

v_a <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device, text) %>%
  filter(device == "Android") %>%
  mutate(urls = str_extract_all(text, urls_as_pattern)) %>%
  select(urls)

tab_a <- data.frame(urls = unlist(v_a)) %>%
  group_by(urls) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 

# Vector of URLs from iPHONE per training set observation  

v_i <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device, text) %>%
  filter(device == "iPhone") %>%
  mutate(urls = str_extract_all(text, urls_as_pattern)) %>%
  select(urls)

tab_i <- data.frame(urls = unlist(v_i)) %>%
  group_by(urls) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Joins both tables.

j <- full_join(tab_a, tab_i, by = "urls")
j <- j %>%
  filter(n.x > 1 | n.y > 1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("URLs",
                 "Instances from Android",
                 "Instances from iPhone"))

# Creates an interactive data table, using the DT package. 

datatable(j, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", 
          
          options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = T,
                         
          # Sets background color and font color in header.              
                         
            initComplete = JS(
              "function(settings, json) {",
              "$(this.api().table().header()).css({
                  'background-color': '#0072B2', 
                  'color': 'white'});", 
              "}"),
            
          # Sets background color in rows.  
            
            rowCallback = JS(
              'function(row, data, index, rowId) {',
              'console.log(rowId)',
              'if(rowId >= 0) {',
                   'row.style.backgroundColor = "#9ad2f2";','}',
              '}')
            )
          )

rm(j)

```

Repeating URLs has only been done by the iPhone. But numbers are limited. This could be tried as a candidate predictor. Tweets with URLs mentionned twice or more have been tweeted by the iPhone. 

Moreover, is the number of URLs per tweet a promising candidate predictor? Let's have a look at the next table.

```{r URL frequency by device}

temp <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(device = as.factor(device)) %>%
  mutate(urls_count = urls_count) 

# Counts number of tweets with no mention.

tab0 <- temp %>%
  filter(urls_count == 0) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of tweets with 1 URL.

tab1 <- temp %>%
  filter(urls_count == 1) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of iPhone tweets with 2 URLs.

tab2 <- temp %>%
  filter(urls_count == 2) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of tweets with 3 or more URLs.

tab3 <- temp %>%
  filter(urls_count >= 3) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Assembles the 5 sub-tables into a global one and
# converts tab from wide format to tidy format for ggplot2.

tab <- cbind(tab0, tab1$n, tab2$n, tab3$n) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("device", "0", "1", "2", ">= 3")) %>%
  gather(key = punct, value = n, `0`:`>= 3`) %>%
  select(punct, device, n)

graph_title <- "Dispersion of URLs"
x_title <- "Number of URLs per Tweet"
y_title <- "Number of Tweets"
angle <- 0
name1 <- "Number of URLs per Tweet"
name2 <- "Number of Tweets"

graphic_function(tab, graph_title, x_title, y_title, 
                 angle, name1, name2)

rm(temp, tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab)

```

That is definitely a powerful predictor: the presence of URL in tweets. Indeed, there are almost no URLs in Android tweets and numerous among iPhone tweets. 

Should we add one or two binary predictors? One predictor would refer to the third column: has the tweet got at least one URL? Almost all 1s would be for the iPhone. 

With two predictors, we would have two binary variables: first variable indicates whether the tweet has exactly one variable or not, the second binary variable indicates whether the tweet has 2 or more URLs. The second predictor would only have 1s for the iPhone. 

Let's deal with mentions.

<br>

### Mentions

Mentions have been identified as strings beginning with @ or .@ and comprised of letters, digits or the underscore mark. 

The distinction between mentions beginning with @ or with .@ even although the dot does not change the account referred to. Actually, using a leading dot or no leading dot can differentiate not the account referred to but the stylistic patterns of the user inserting or not inserting a leading dot in front of the mentions she or he uses in her or his tweets. The presence or absence of leading dot can be a predictive pattern in tweet attribution.

```{r Mentions 1}

buffer <- tweets_without_urls$text

# Extracting mentions.
v <- str_extract_all(buffer, "\\.@\\w+|@\\w+")

# For each tweet, having all mentions in a string.

mentions_per_tweet <- 
  vector(mode = "character", length = length(v))

for (i in 1:length(mentions_per_tweet)) {

  mentions_per_tweet[[i]] <- 
    str_trim(paste(unlist(v[i]), sep = "", collapse = " "))
  
}

# Number of mentions per tweet

mentions_count <- str_count(buffer, "\\.@\\w+|@\\w+")

# Vector of unique mentions

unique_mentions <- unique(unlist(v))

# Table: statistics about mention instances 

tab <- data.frame(a = 1, b = 2) %>%
  mutate(a = sum(mentions_count), 
         b = length(unique_mentions)) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Number of Mentions",
                 "Number of Unique Mentions"))

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c",  
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-primary\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

rm(tab)

```

Many repetitions. We'll investigate.  

```{r Mentions 2, class.output = "bg-primary"}

buffer <- tweets_without_urls$text

# Vector with count for each Android mention

v_a <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(text = buffer) %>%
  filter(device == "Android") %>%
  mutate(v = str_extract_all(text, "\\.@\\w+|@\\w+")) %>%
  .$v

tab_a <- data.frame(mentions = unlist(v_a)) %>%
  group_by(mentions) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 

# Vector with count for each Android mention  

v_i <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(text = buffer) %>%
  filter(device == "iPhone") %>%
  mutate(v = str_extract_all(text, "\\.@\\w+|@\\w+")) %>%
  .$v

tab_i <- data.frame(mentions = unlist(v_i)) %>%
  group_by(mentions) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Assembles both tables into a global one.

j <- full_join(tab_a, tab_i, by = "mentions")
j <- j %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Mentions",
                 "Instances from Android",
                 "Instances from iPhone"))

# Creates an interactive data table, using the DT package. 

datatable(j, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", 
          
          options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = T,
                         
          # Sets background color and font color in header.              
                         
            initComplete = JS(
              "function(settings, json) {",
              "$(this.api().table().header()).css({
                  'background-color': '#0072B2', 
                  'color': 'white'});", 
              "}"),
            
          # Sets background color in rows.  
            
            rowCallback = JS(
              'function(row, data, index, rowId) {',
              'console.log(rowId)',
              'if(rowId >= 0) {',
                   'row.style.backgroundColor = "#9ad2f2";','}',
              '}')
            )
          )

# Keeping j for further use with simple format.

table_mentions <- j %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("mentions", "n_a", "n_i"))

rm(j)

```

For some mentions, imbalance is substantial in favor of the Android device for a few mentions, e.g. @CNN or @nytimes. These mentions can be used as candidate predictors when predicting in tweet attribution. 

Leading dot usage can help differentiate devices in some cases: e.g. .@CNN is only used by the Android device (12 times) while @CNN is also used by the iPhone, much less though. Let's keep the distinction between @ and .@ . 

It is not uninteresting to notice the importance of capitalization. Some mentions are written in different ways, once with all or some capitalization and once with less or no capitalization. This is the case for @Mike_Pence and @mike_pence. This will not be harmonized, even if both refer to the same username. Indeed, frequency can differ between the two versions. For @Mike_Pence, the iPhone has 8 instances and the Android device none; for @mike_pence, the numbers of instances are 4 and 2. In other words, the Android device nevers capitalizes Mike Pence's name. If we keep the two versions separated, we have got a clear-cut divergence between the two devices for @Mike_Pence.

Now, let's examine how many mentions tweets are comprised of by device. 

```{r Mentions 3}

temp <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(device = as.factor(device)) %>%
  mutate(mentions_count = mentions_count) 

# Counts number of tweets with no mention.

tab0 <- temp %>%
  filter(mentions_count == 0) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of tweets with 1 mention.

tab1 <- temp %>%
  filter(mentions_count == 1) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of iPhone tweets with 2 mentions.

tab2 <- temp %>%
  filter(mentions_count == 2) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of tweets with 3 or more mentions.

tab3 <- temp %>%
  filter(mentions_count >= 3) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Assembles the 5 sub-tables into a global one and
# converts tab from wide format to tidy format for ggplot2.

tab <- cbind(tab0, tab1$n, tab2$n, tab3$n) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("device", "0", "1", "2", ">= 3")) %>%
  gather(key = punct, value = n, `0`:`>= 3`) %>%
  select(punct, device, n)

graph_title <- "Dispersion of Mentions"
x_title <- "Number of Mentions per Tweet"
y_title <- "Number of Tweets"
angle <- 0
name1 <- "Number of Mentions per Tweet"
name2 <- "Number of Tweets"

graphic_function(tab, graph_title, x_title, y_title, 
                 angle, name1, name2)

rm(temp, tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab)

```

The picture is completely different from the URL picture. The Android device predominates but imbalance is limited. Proportional imbalance is the biggest for 2 mentions per tweet. We'll keep the number of mentions per tweet as a candidate predictor. 

Last, let's switch to the hashtags.

<br>

### Hashtags

The hashtags have been identified as string beginning with # and comprised of letters, digits and underscore marks. Consequently, #'s has been considered as meaning "numbers". It has been automatically eliminated by the code below.

The strings #1 and #2 have not been counted as mentions if they are followed neither by a letter, or a digit or an underscore mark. They seem to mean *number 1* or *number 2*. #1 or #2 seem meant as quantifiers and not as hashtags. 

On the contrary, the string #2A has been kept: *this hashtag indicated the user's intention to direct the posting to the attention of Twitter users in the context of the Second Amendment, which refers to citizens' right to bear arms* according to https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=meaning+of+hashtag+%232A .

```{r Number of hashtags and unique hashtags}

# Adding leading empty space because some hashtags stick to each other.

Many repetitions. It will be interesting to differentiate per device. For each device, which are the favorite hashtags? 

```{r Hashtags 2, class.output = "bg-primary"}

# Vector with count for each Android hashtag  

v_a <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(text = buffer) %>%

  mutate(v = str_extract_all(text, "#\\w+")) %>%

  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Assembles both tables into a global one.

j <- full_join(tab_a, tab_i, by = "hashtags")
j <- j %>%
  arrange(desc(n.y)) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Hashtags",
                 "Instances from Android",
                 "Instances from iPhone"))

# Creates an interactive data table, using the DT package. 

datatable(j, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", 
          
          options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = T,
                         
          # Sets background color and font color in header.              
                         
            initComplete = JS(
              "function(settings, json) {",
              "$(this.api().table().header()).css({
                  'background-color': '#0072B2', 
                  'color': 'white'});", 
              "}"),
            
          # Sets background color in rows.  
            
            rowCallback = JS(
              'function(row, data, index, rowId) {',
              'console.log(rowId)',
              'if(rowId >= 0) {',
                   'row.style.backgroundColor = "#9ad2f2";','}',
              '}')
            )
          )

# Keeping j for further use with simple format.

table_hashtags <- j %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("hashtags", "n_a", "n_i"))

rm(j)

```

There is predominance of the iPhone for almost all hashtags. The number of hashtags per tweet looks like a very promising candidate predictor. Should we also add candidate predictors for hashtags with the heaviest imbalances? 

Let's quantify the global imbalance between the two devices. 

```{r Hashtags 3}

temp <- train_tweets %>%
  select(device) %>%
  mutate(device = as.factor(device)) %>%
  mutate(hashtags_count = hashtags_count) 

# Counts number of tweets with no mention.

tab0 <- temp %>%
  filter(hashtags_count == 0) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of tweets with 1 URL.

tab1 <- temp %>%
  filter(hashtags_count == 1) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of iPhone tweets with 2 URLs.

tab2 <- temp %>%
  filter(hashtags_count == 2) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Counts number of tweets with 3 or more URLs.

tab3 <- temp %>%
  filter(hashtags_count >= 3) %>%
  group_by(device, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

# Assembles the 5 sub-tables into a global one and
# converts tab from wide format to tidy format for ggplot2.

tab <- cbind(tab0, tab1$n, tab2$n, tab3$n) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("device", "0", "1", "2", ">= 3")) %>%
  gather(key = punct, value = n, `0`:`>= 3`) %>%
  select(punct, device, n)

graph_title <- "Dispersion of Hashtags"
x_title <- "Number of Hashtags per Tweet"
y_title <- "Number of Hashtags"
angle <- 0
name1 <- "Number of Hashtags per Tweet"
name2 <- "Number of Tweets"

graphic_function(tab, graph_title, x_title, y_title, 
                 angle, name1, name2)

rm(temp, tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab)

```

Picture very much indeed like the one with URLs: huge predominance from iPhone. Same question: one or two binary predictors? But undoubtedly a very promising predictor.

## Stylometric Predictors

Let's build a data frame with all candidate predictors originating in the stylometric Exploratory Data Analysis conducted above. The first ones are the count variables for URLs, mentions and hashtags. 

```{r Creating data frame receptacle for all stylometric predictors}

# Data frame with the first stylometric predictors. 
stylo <- data.frame( 
  urls_count = urls_count,
  mentions_count = mentions_count,
  hashtags_count = hashtags_count)

# Numerous stylometric predictors 
# will be added in the code chunks below.

```

### Mention Predictors

Then come the top mentions, with one count variable for each of them. 

```{r Preparing stylometric predictors from mentions}

# Selecting frequent mentions

top_mentions <- table_mentions %>%
  filter(n_a >= 10 | n_i >= 10) %>%
  mutate(mentions = str_trim(mentions)) %>%
  .$mentions

# Mentions with leading dot need escape characters
# to correctly detect instances from tweets.

top_mentions <- 
  str_replace_all(top_mentions, "\\.", "\\\\\\.")

# In tweets leading empty characters are inserted
# in front of @ and .@ for detection convenience. 

buffer <- 
  str_replace_all(tweets_without_urls$text, 
                  "([^\\.])(@)", "\\1 \\2")
buffer <- 
  str_replace_all(buffer, "(\\.@)", " \\1")

# Constructing a data frame as receptacle 
# for top mention predictors. 
  
df_mentions <- 
  data.frame(matrix(nrow(tweets_without_urls) * length(top_mentions),
             nrow = nrow(tweets_without_urls), 
             ncol =  length(top_mentions)) * 1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(str_replace_all(top_mentions, "\\\\\\.", "\\."))

# Counting instances of top mentions.

for (i in 1:length(top_mentions)) {

  df_mentions[, i] <- 
    str_count(buffer, 
              paste("\\s", top_mentions[i], "\\s|\\s", 
                    top_mentions[i], "[:punct:]|\\s", 
                    top_mentions[i], "$", 
                    sep = "", collapse = ""))

}

stylo <- cbind(stylo, df_mentions)

rm(df_mentions)

```

### Hashtag Predictors

Then come the top hashtags, with one count variable for each of them. 

```{r Preparing stylometric predictors from hashtags}

# Selecting frequent hashtags.

top_hashtags <- table_hashtags %>%
  filter(n_a >= 10 | n_i >= 10) %>%
  mutate(hashtags = str_trim(hashtags)) %>%
  .$hashtags

# In tweets leading empty characters are inserted
# in front of # because some hashtags stick to each other. 

buffer <- str_replace_all(tweets_without_urls$text, 
                          "#", " #")

# Constructing a data frame as receptacle for top hashtag predictors. 
  
df_hashtags <- 
  data.frame(matrix(nrow(tweets_without_urls) * length(top_hashtags),
             nrow = nrow(tweets_without_urls), 
             ncol =  length(top_hashtags)) * 1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(str_replace_all(top_hashtags, "\\\\\\.", "\\."))

# Counting instances of top mentions.

for (i in 1:length(top_hashtags)) {

  df_hashtags[, i] <- 
    str_count(buffer, 
              paste("\\s", top_hashtags[i], "\\s|\\s", 
                    top_hashtags[i], "[:punct:]|\\s", 
                    top_hashtags[i], "$", 
                    sep = "", collapse = ""))

}

stylo <- cbind(stylo, df_hashtags)

rm(df_hashtags)

```



### Punctuation Predictors

Now punctuation marks:

- question marks,
- commas,
- colons,
- semi-colons,
- slashes,
- dollar signs,
- slashes,
- opening parentheses (opening round brackets),
- closing parentheses (closing round brackets),
- double quotation marks,
- double hyphens.

These punctuation marks are looked for outside of URLs, which are dealt with separately.

Dots will be dealt with among special sequences, because we will differentiate single dots and dots in a row. 

The percentage mark will also be dealt with among special sequences where we will look for sequences that are comprised of numbers and the percentage mark. 



A separate code chunk will be dedicated to the punctuation mark ' because it can be either a single quote or an apostrophe. Disentangling is somewhat challenging and requires a *sui generis* approach. 

```{r Preparing stylometric predictors from punctuation}

# Selecting frequent punctuation marks. 

top_punctuation_marks <- 
  c("?", ",", ":", ";", "/", "$", "(", ")", '"', "--")

# Constructing a data frame as receptacle 
# for top punctuation mark predictors. 

l <- length(top_punctuation_marks)
n <- nrow(tweets_without_urls)

df_punctuation <- 
  data.frame(matrix(n * l, nrow = n, ncol =  l) * 1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(top_punctuation_marks)

# Counting instances of top punctuation marks.

for (i in 1:length(top_punctuation_marks)) {

  df_punctuation[, i] <- 
    str_count(tweets_without_urls$text, 
              fixed(top_punctuation_marks[i]))

}

stylo <- cbind(stylo, df_punctuation)

rm(df_punctuation)

```

*&* would be a goo candidate predictor as well, but actually it is the sequence *&amp*. There is exactly the same number of instances. This will be taken care of under special sequences. 

### Enclosed Punctuation Predictors

Now enclosed punctuation marks.

```{r Preparing stylometric predictors from enclosed punctuation}

# Selecting frequent punctuation marks. 

top_enclosed_punctuation <- 
  c(",", "\\:", "\\/", "\\-", "\\)", '"')

# Constructing a data frame as receptacle 
# for top enclosed punctuation mark predictors. 

l <- length(top_enclosed_punctuation)
n <- nrow(tweets_without_urls)
colnam <- 
  str_replace_all(top_enclosed_punctuation, "\\\\", "\\")

df_enclosed_punctuation <- 
  data.frame(matrix(n * l, nrow = n, ncol =  l) * 1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(colnam)

# Counting instances of top punctuation marks.

for (i in 1:length(top_enclosed_punctuation)) {
  
  buffer <- paste("\\S", top_enclosed_punctuation[i], "\\S", sep = "")

  df_enclosed_punctuation[, i] <- 
    str_count(tweets_without_urls$text, buffer)

}

stylo <- cbind(stylo, df_enclosed_punctuation)

rm(df_enclosed_punctuation)

```








(outside of )

- semi-colons,
- slashes,
- opening parentheses,
- closing parentheses,
- double quotes,
- single quotes (no apostrophes),
- 3 or 4 dots in a row,
- double hyphens,
- dots enclosed but not in suspension points, 
- non enclosed slashes, 


stylo_plus

- dots not enclosed and not in suspension points,
- question marks,
- commas,
- colons,
- dollar signs,
- ampersands,
- enclosed commas,
- enclosed slashes,



We are now moving text mining, well word mining.

The \\1 is syntax for the last capture in a regular expression using the () 
It says whatever was matched, replace it with that. 
I put only the "." and "-" in the group (), so \\1 will replace .- 
(by the same vale), so it keeps them here. – agstudy Feb 3 '14 at 20:02

Extracting hashtags
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13762868/how-do-i-extract-hashtags-from-tweets-in-r
There are two levels of parsing going on here. 
Before the low level regexp function within str_extract 
gets the pattern you want to search for (i.e. "#\S+") 
it is first parsed by R. R does not recognize \S 
as a valid escape character and throws an error. 
By escaping the slash with \\ you tell R to pass the \ and S 
as two normal characters to the regexp function, 
instead of interpreting it as one escape character.
v <- str_extract_all(train_tweets$text, "#\\S+")
